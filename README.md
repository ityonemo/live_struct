# LiveStruct

LiveStruct is a tool that lets you use a struct as the 'assigns'
of a `Phoenix.LiveView`.

Note this is probably done, but it's still alpha, and it *might* cause
problems with LiveView in the future.

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `live_struct` to your list of
dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:live_struct, "~> 0.1.0", runtime: false}
  ]
end
```
